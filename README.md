# imran'sLab Manim Video

A small Manim project that builds a simple branded intro sequence composed of two scenes and one combined scene:

- Opening branding (logo + tagline)
- Middle content (intro, fun fact, why excited)
- Full video that stitches opening → middle → opening again

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Manim Community (tested on v0.19.x)
- FFmpeg installed and available on PATH
  - Windows Download from web `https://ffmpeg.org/`
  - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
  - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg`

If you plan to render SVG logos, place your SVG at `assets/imranslab_logo.svg`.

---

## Installation

Install dependencies in a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
# create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
# Windows PowerShell
./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
# macOS/Linux
# source venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Project Structure

- `opening_branding.py`: Opening scene with logo + tagline and background color
- `middle_part.py`: Middle scene with a few animated text beats
- `main_video.py`: Combined scene that plays opening → middle → opening again
- `assets/branding_image.png`: Default logo image (PNG/JPG)
- `assets/imranslab_logo.svg` (optional): SVG logo fallback
- `media/`: Output directory generated by Manim (videos/ and images/)

---

## Quick Start

- Opening branding only:

```bash
manim -pql opening_branding.py OpeningBranding
```

- Middle content only:

```bash
manim -pql middle_part.py MiddlePart
```

- Full combined video (opening → middle → opening):

```bash
manim -pql main_video.py FullVideo
```

Use `-pqh` for high quality; omit `-p` to skip preview. Common quality flags:

- `-ql`: low quality (fastest)
- `-qm`: medium quality
- `-qh`: high quality
- `-p`: preview after render

Outputs go to `media/videos/<module>/<quality>/<SceneName>.mp4`.

---

## Customization

- Opening branding (`opening_branding.py`)

  - Logo image: add/replace `assets/branding_image.png` (recommended)
  - Optional SVG: `assets/imranslab_logo.svg`
  - Tagline text: edit the line similar to `Text("We Are Experts In Design, App, and Developments")`
  - Colors: look for variables like `COLOR_TEXT` and `COLOR_BACKGROUND`

- Middle content (`middle_part.py`)

  - Replace placeholder lines with your own text
  - Colors/background: `COLOR_TEXT`, `COLOR_BACKGROUND`
  - Background animation: animated dots; timings tied to text sections

- Full video (`main_video.py`)
  - Sequence calls the two scenes' `construct` methods in order
  - Adjust durations or transitions inside each scene if desired

Tips:

- If you change fonts, ensure the fonts are installed on your system. Manim will fall back if a font is missing.
- For brand colors, define them once as constants and reuse across scenes to keep visuals consistent.

## Storyboarding Plan (OpeningBranding + MiddlePart)

This plan mirrors the actual copy, motions, and timings implemented in `opening_branding.py` and `middle_part.py`. Total target duration for both scenes together is ~30–36s; the full composition replays the opening at the end in `FullVideo`.

- Goals

  - Quickly establish brand (logo + tagline) with clean, minimal design
  - Present a concise personal intro, a fun fact, and why you’re excited
  - End on a strong brand hold suitable for a clean cut, loop, or thumbnail

- Visual Language

  - Background: brand gray (`#7e7979`), high-contrast text (`#424040`)
  - Subtle background dots for depth (low opacity), slow vertical drift
  - Smooth fades and small scale pulses; no busy transitions

- Scene Breakdown and Timing (as per code)

  - S0: OpeningBranding (~8–10s)

    - Elements from code: image logo (PNG) or SVG if available; fallback `Text("Imran's Lab")`. `SurroundingRectangle` around the logo; tagline `"We Are Experts In Design, App, and Developments"` below.
    - Motion (implemented):
      - FadeIn dots (~0.6s), FadeIn logo group and tagline with slight vertical shifts
      - Subtle pulse: group scales 1.05 then returns (1.5s + 1.5s)
      - Background drift up (2.8s, linear)
      - Quick pop via `there_and_back` scale (0.6s), then FadeOut all
    - Suggested hold: allow at least ~1.0s of readable tagline before transition

  - S1: MiddlePart – About Me (~6–7s visible)

    - Copy (from code):
      - Title: `About Me`
      - Line: `Hi, I'm Saifur Rahman.`
      - Paragraph: `Background: BSc in Computer Science and Engineering` / `from North South University`
    - Motion (implemented): FadeIn group (slight down shift), background dots drift up (run_time=6, linear), FadeOut group

  - S2: MiddlePart – Fun Fact (~6–7s visible)

    - Copy (from code):
      - Title: `Fun Fact`
      - Paragraph: `I love coding, but I also love cooking.` / `I often cook for myself.`
    - Motion (implemented): FadeIn group (slight up shift), background dots drift up (run_time=6), FadeOut group

  - S3: MiddlePart – Why I'm Excited (~8–9s visible)

    - Copy (from code):
      - Title: `Why I'm Excited`
      - Lines: `Thrilled to learn and contribute at Imran's Lab.` / `Passionate about design, apps, and development.` / `Eager to collaborate and build impactful projects!`
    - Motion (implemented): FadeIn group (slight down shift), background dots drift up (run_time=8), FadeOut group

  - S4: MiddlePart – End Card (~2–3s)
    - Copy (from code): `Thank you!`
    - Motion (implemented): FadeIn, short background drift (run_time=2), FadeOut with dots

- Transitions

  - Between beats in `MiddlePart`: hard swap via FadeOut current group → FadeIn next group (keeps clarity and pace)
  - Between `OpeningBranding` and `MiddlePart`: FadeOut to clean background then next beat FadeIn
  - In `FullVideo`, the opening branding is used again at the end for a branded outro

- Motion and Easing

  - Background drift uses `linear` for calm motion; keep distances small
  - Scale pulses use gentle `there_and_back`; avoid large overshoots
  - Keep transitions ~200–400ms; ensure readable holds (≥1.0–1.5s per key line)

- Accessibility & Brand Safety

  - Maintain strong contrast between text and background
  - Keep safe margins around logo and text; avoid edge crowding
  - Limit motion amplitude to be comfortable for sensitive viewers

- Deliverables
  - 1080p MP4 renders for `OpeningBranding`, `MiddlePart`, and `FullVideo`
  - Final thumbnail suggestion: last brand hold from the closing `OpeningBranding`

Implementation notes:

- Text and timing are already implemented; adjust `run_time` and `Wait` calls if refining pace
- Replace copy directly in `middle_part.py` for personalized content
- Swap in your logo image at `assets/branding_image.png` or an SVG fallback

## Rendering Tips

- Use `-pql` for fast iteration; switch to `-pqh` when finalizing.
- You can render to a specific resolution and frame rate, for example:

```bash
manim -pqh -r 1920,1080 --fps 60 main_video.py FullVideo
```

- To clean old artifacts between iterations, you can remove the `media/` subfolders for the relevant module/quality.

---

## Troubleshooting

- FFmpeg not found
  - Ensure FFmpeg is installed and available on your PATH (see prerequisites above).
- Fonts look different or default
  - Confirm the desired font is installed on your system. On Windows, you may need to restart after installing new fonts so Manim detects them.
- Slow renders
  - Use `-ql` for quick previews. Reduce resolution and frame rate while iterating.
- Manim version issues
  - This project targets Manim Community v0.19.x. If you are on a different version and encounter errors, try creating a fresh venv and installing the versions from `requirements.txt`.

## Commands Cheat Sheet

- Opening branding (preview, low quality):
  ```bash
  manim -pql opening_branding.py OpeningBranding
  ```

  ```bash
  manim -pql middle_part.py MiddlePart
  ```
- Full combined video (preview, low quality):

## Notes

- Output videos are written to `media/videos/...`.
- Windows PowerShell examples are the same as above commands.
- For reproducibility, keep your Python and Manim versions consistent across machines.
